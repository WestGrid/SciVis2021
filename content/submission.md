<!--   for the manuscript. (you can download LaTeX and Word templates from this site). -->
<!-- - Images which explain how your visualizations help answering the questions. The images should be appended to the 2-page -->
<!--   document (thus, your whole PDF document should have more than 2 pages). The PDF document should be no bigger than 50 -->
<!--   MB in size. -->
<!-- - An MPEG, AVI, or Quicktime video (duration at most 10 minutes) showing the system, methods, or processes in -->
