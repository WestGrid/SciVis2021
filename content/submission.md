<!-- We will post the submission guidelines in May 2021, as we get closer to July-31 submission deadline. -->


## September 2021 update

We had seven submissions this year. All submissions were accepted to be presented at the 2021 SciVis Contest session at
[IEEE Vis](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/welcome) on October 28<sup>th</sup>. After the session some of the submission
details and ideas will be revealed on this website.

## Contest process

The submission deadline is July 31<sup>st</sup>, 2021, 11:59pm Pacific Time (PDT). Your submission should include:
<!-- We will open submissions in early May. -->

- A 2-page PDF paper describing your visualization and analysis techniques. Focus on the techniques you used and results
  you obtained. Do not waste space on background information or data description. Please follow the
  [formatting guidelines for the manuscript](https://kaust-vislab.github.io/SciVis2020/submission.html) where you can
  download LaTeX and Word templates.
- Images that explain how your visualizations help answer the questions. The images should be appended to the 2-page
  document (thus, your whole PDF document should have more than 2 pages). The PDF document should be no bigger than 50
  MB in size.
- An MPEG-4, H.264 or Quicktime video (duration at most 10 minutes) showing the system, methods, or processes in
  action. This will be most helpful for demonstrating the effectiveness of your approach.

<!-- The complete guidelines **will be posted shortly**. -->

To submit:

1. Visit https://new.precisionconference.com/vgtc.
1. Sign in or create an account.
1. Read and accept the privacy policy and terms and conditions.
1. Once the account is created, go to the Submissions tab, choose the following options and press Go:
![Submissions form](../images/submissions.png)
1. Edit the submission with your data and record the changes.

The review process will be single- or double-blind: we leave it to the discretion of the authors whether they want to
disclose their identity in their submission materials (the PDF with images and the video).





Accepted submission PDFs will be published in the 2021 IEEE Vis "USB download" proceedings. We will notify authors of
the accepted entries of any changes they need to make to their entry before publication. We will also invite these
authors to pre-record a short video presentation for the IEEE Vis conference. The deadline for these presentations will
be September 21<sup>st</sup>, 2021.

After the conference, the top team will be invited to submit a full journal article (with an expedited review process)
to IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications (CG&A) Journal.





# Prizes

This year, due to the pandemic and the recent decision to hold the IEEE Vis Conference virtually, we will not be able to
give out prizes, as is normally done in-person at the conference.




<!-- Compute Canada's previous *Visualize This!* prizes included 4K monitors and SSD drives. -->
<!-- Normally providing prizes to the winning team(s) -- one prize per team.  -->
<!-- All accepted submissions, subject to review, will be featured in the conference USB stick. -->
<!-- A poster at the conference for the winning entry. Depending on availability, other teams may be invited to submit a poster. -->
