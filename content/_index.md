Compute Canada is partnering with IEEE Vis to co-host the IEEE SciVis Contest in 2021. For us it is a great
international marketing opportunity, and the ability to reach for submissions from outside Canada.

We need your help to identify a research dataset that can be used for this competition. Have you worked with a
researcher or do you know of anyone within our user community whose dataset would fit this criteria:

1. The dataset must be unrestricted, public release without any IP issues.
1. The dataset should be sufficiently challenging and potentially leading to a beautiful visualization, but easy to
   understand for non-domain specialists.
1. The dataset cannot be too large, so that one does not require HPC resources to analyze/visualize it; a time-dependent
   simulation where each timestep is under ~4-8 GB is probably Ok.
1. Ideally, the data should be from a domain different from the [last few IEEE SciVis contests](../previous).

If you recently worked with a researcher who you think might have an interesting dataset for this Contest, please put
them in [touch with us](mailto:alex.razoumov@westgrid.ca).

<!-- The details -- dataset, timeline, website -- of the 2021 Contest will be announced at the IEEE Vis conference (online -->
<!-- this year) in October 2020. So, over the next 1.5 months we need your help to reach out to Compute Canada researchers -->
<!-- running numerical simulations to find several good dataset candidates and then pick one for this competition. -->

<!-- IEEE has been running their Visualization Contests since 2004, while Compute Canada has been running the Visualize This -->
<!-- challenge since 2016. This joint contest is an exciting way to combine our efforts for one year in 2021.  -->

**Benefits for domain scientists:**

1. an opportunity to advertise their work,
1. have someone create a stunning visualization showcasing their research,
1. a chance to crowdsource innovative visualization ideas and to apply new visualization techniques to their data.

The domain scientist will provide the dataset along with some background material (how to work with the data and the
problem description), will help us define the visualization-related tasks, and will also help in judging all
submissions.
