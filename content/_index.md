<font size="6"> SciVis Contest 2021: Earth's Mantle Convection </font>

*The 2021 IEEE SciVis Contest is dedicated to creating novel approaches and state-of-the-art visualizations to assist
domain scientists to better understand the convection processes in the Earth's mantle.*

#### Science background

Mid-mantle stagnation of sinking slabs is prevalent globally in seismic tomographic images. However, the existence of
such high velocity anomalies at different depths in the lower mantle is not fully explained.

One possibility is that the iron spin transition (theoretically predicted by Fyfe in 1960) in the lower-mantle minerals
can influence their density, thermal conductivity, thermal expansivity and bulk modulus (resistance to
compression). Both theoretical and experimental studies in the past two decades reveal that in the most abundant
lower-mantle minerals -- aluminous silicate perovskite Al-(Mg,Fe)SiO3 and ferropericlase (Mg,Fe)O (with the respective
volumetric contributions of ~62% and ~33% in the lower mantle) -- iron undergoes a transition from high spin in the
mid-mantle to low spin at the bottom of the mantle.

<!-- While there is a monotonic increase in the mantle density due to the electronic transition in Fe from mid-mantle to the -->
<!-- core-mantle boundary (CMB), the influence of spin transition at mid-mantle depths is complex. In ferropericlase the -->
<!-- transition causes an increase in thermal expansivity and softening in the elastic moduli (decrease in the bulk -->
<!-- modulus). Although there is no yet robust experimental evidence for spin-transition induced density change in the -->
<!-- perovskite (Pv) phase, the spin transition in the octahedral (B) site in Al-free perovskite causes a bulk modulus -->
<!-- hardening (increase in the bulk modulus) in the mineral in the mixed spin state. -->

The overall impact of the changes in the properties of ferropericlase and perovskite is such that a descending cold slab
approaching the mid-mantle at ~1600 km depth gains negative buoyancy (decrease in density) that can slow the slab's
descent rate or cause its stagnation. A stagnated slab may eventually penetrate the lower mantle in the form of a sudden
spin-transition induced mid-mantle avalanche (SIMMA). On the other hand, the rising hot plumes from the core-mantle
boundary that are slightly lighter due to the spin-transition effects in the lower mantle become slightly heavier at the
mid-mantle depths. This in turn may slow the plumes or cause their stagnation at ~1600 km depth. Stagnated plumes may
merge together and eventually reach the upper levels of the lower mantle as *superplumes*.

<!-- energy and biogeochemical particles in the ocean. We use a high-resolution Massachusetts Institute of Technology general -->
<!-- circulation model (MITgcm), together with remote sensing satellite observations, to simulate and study the circulation -->
<!-- dynamics and to investigate the eddy activities of the Red Sea. Given the narrow nature of the basin, many eddies can -->
<!-- occupy more than half of the Red Sea width, providing rapid transport of organisms and nutrients along the coastline and -->
<!-- between the african and Arabian Peninsula coasts. These marine ‘whirlpools’ are much more frequent than what had been -->
<!-- previously thought, profoundly affecting the social and economic lives of people living in the surrounding countries. -->
<!-- Thomas: Advanced visualization techniques should enable for better detection capabilities and deeper knowledge of how -->
<!-- regularly these eddies occur and how they behave. This will, in particular, help investigating oceanic dynamics across -->
<!-- different scales and improve local ocean forecasts, as well as provide tools for the coastguard to undertake -->
<!-- search-and-rescues, the authorities to plan for oil spills responses or concentrate discharges, and to formulate -->
<!-- conservation plans. -->

<!-- Compute Canada is partnering with IEEE Vis to co-host the IEEE SciVis Contest in 2021. For Compute Canada it is a great -->
<!-- international marketing opportunity and the ability to reach for submissions from outside Canada. -->

<!-- We are looking for a 3D scientific dataset that can be used for this competition. The dataset should fit these criteria: -->

<!-- 1. The dataset must be unrestricted, public release without any IP issues. -->
<!-- 1. The dataset should be sufficiently challenging and potentially leading to a beautiful visualization, but easy to -->
<!--    understand for non-domain specialists. -->
<!-- 1. The dataset cannot be too large, so that one does not require HPC resources to analyze/visualize it. A time-dependent -->
<!--    simulation where each timestep is under ~4-8 GB is probably Ok. -->
<!-- 1. Ideally, the data should be from a domain different from the [last few IEEE SciVis contests](../previous). -->

<!-- If you a researcher with an interesting dataset for this Contest, or you recently worked with a researcher who you think -->
<!-- might have such a dataset, please [let us know](mailto:alex.razoumov@westgrid.ca). -->

<!-- <\!-- The details -- dataset, timeline, website -- of the 2021 Contest will be announced at the IEEE Vis conference (online -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- this year) in October 2020. So, over the next 1.5 months we need your help to reach out to Compute Canada researchers -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- running numerical simulations to find several good dataset candidates and then pick one for this competition. -\-> -->

<!-- <\!-- IEEE has been running their Visualization Contests since 2004, while Compute Canada has been running the Visualize This -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- challenge since 2016. This joint contest is an exciting way to combine our efforts for one year in 2021.  -\-> -->

<!-- **Benefits for domain scientists:** -->

<!-- 1. An opportunity to advertise your work both in Canada and internationally: -->
<!--     1. the challenge will be presented at the IEEE Vis Conference 2020 (online), -->
<!--     1. the dataset will be described on our website, -->
<!--     1. there will be a separate session at IEEE Vis 2021 (October next year) dedicated to the results of the Contest, and -->
<!--     1. the winner will be invited to submit a paper on their visualization technique to IEEE Computer Graphics and -->
<!--        Applications (see the 2019 paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9126163)). -->
<!-- 1. You will have someone create a stunning visualization showcasing your research. -->
<!-- 1. This is a chance to crowdsource innovative visualization ideas and to apply new visualization techniques to your data. -->

<!-- The domain scientist will provide the dataset along with some background material (how to work with the data and the -->
