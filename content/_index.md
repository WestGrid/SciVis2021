Compute Canada is partnering with IEEE Vis to co-host the IEEE SciVis Contest in 2021. For Compute Canada it is a great
international marketing opportunity and the ability to reach for submissions from outside Canada.

We are looking for a 3D scientific dataset that can be used for this competition. The dataset should fit this criteria:

1. The dataset must be unrestricted, public release without any IP issues.
1. The dataset should be sufficiently challenging and potentially leading to a beautiful visualization, but easy to
   understand for non-domain specialists.
1. The dataset cannot be too large, so that one does not require HPC resources to analyze/visualize it. A time-dependent
   simulation where each timestep is under ~4-8 GB is probably Ok.
1. Ideally, the data should be from a domain different from the [last few IEEE SciVis contests](../previous).

If you a researcher with an interesting dataset for this Contest, or you recently worked with a researcher who you think
might have such a dataset, please [let us know](mailto:alex.razoumov@westgrid.ca).

<!-- The details -- dataset, timeline, website -- of the 2021 Contest will be announced at the IEEE Vis conference (online -->
<!-- this year) in October 2020. So, over the next 1.5 months we need your help to reach out to Compute Canada researchers -->
<!-- running numerical simulations to find several good dataset candidates and then pick one for this competition. -->

<!-- IEEE has been running their Visualization Contests since 2004, while Compute Canada has been running the Visualize This -->
<!-- challenge since 2016. This joint contest is an exciting way to combine our efforts for one year in 2021.  -->

**Benefits for domain scientists:**

1. An opportunity to advertise your work both in Canada and internationally:
    1. the challenge will be presented at the IEEE Vis Conference 2020 (online),
    1. the dataset will be described on our website,
    1. there will be a separate session at IEEE Vis 2021 (October next year) dedicated to the results of the Contest, and
    1. the winner will be invited to submit a paper on their visualization technique to IEEE Computer Graphics and
       Applications (see the 2019 paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9126163)).
1. You will have someone create a stunning visualization showcasing your research.
1. This is a chance to crowdsource innovative visualization ideas and to apply new visualization techniques to your data.

The domain scientist will provide the dataset along with some background material (how to work with the data and the
problem description), will help us define the visualization-related tasks, and will also help in judging all
submissions.
