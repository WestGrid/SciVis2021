<font size="6"> SciVis Contest 2021: Earth's Mantle Convection </font>

*The 2021 IEEE SciVis Contest is dedicated to creating novel approaches and state-of-the-art visualizations to assist
domain scientists to better understand the convection processes in the Earth's mantle. Contest participants will be
invited to present at the special SciVis Contest session at IEEE Vis 2021 on October 23 - 28, 2021 [^1], and the top
team will be invited to submit a full journal article (with an expedited review process) to IEEE Computer Graphics and
Applications (CG&A) Journal. The contest is sponsored by [IEEE Vis](http://ieeevis.org) and
[Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca).*

<!-- It is expected that the contest winner(s) will submit a full journal article to IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications -->
<!-- (CG&A). -->

<!-- A poster at the conference for the winning entry. Depending on availability, other teams may get a poster. This has to -->
<!-- be coordinated with the respective poster chairs and will be offered at their discretion. -->

[^1]: Due to uncertainty around COVID-19 presence in October, IEEE Vis 2021 will take place in a virtual format (same
online format as in 2020).

#### Science background

Mid-mantle stagnation of sinking slabs is prevalent globally in seismic tomographic images. However, the existence of
such high velocity anomalies at different depths in the lower mantle is not fully explained.

One possibility is that the iron spin transition (theoretically predicted by Fyfe in 1960) in the lower-mantle minerals
can influence their density, thermal conductivity, thermal expansivity and bulk modulus (resistance to compression). The
most abundant lower-mantle materials are **aluminous silicate perovskite Al-(Mg,Fe)SiO3** and **ferropericlase
(Mg,Fe)O**, with the respective volumetric contributions of ~62% and ~33%. Both theoretical and experimental studies in
the past two decades reveal that in these two minerals iron undergoes a transition from high spin in the mid-mantle to
low spin at the bottom of the mantle.

<!-- While there is a monotonic increase in the mantle density due to the electronic transition in Fe from mid-mantle to the -->
<!-- core-mantle boundary (CMB), the influence of spin transition at mid-mantle depths is complex. In ferropericlase the -->
<!-- transition causes an increase in thermal expansivity and softening in the elastic moduli (decrease in the bulk -->
<!-- modulus). Although there is no yet robust experimental evidence for spin-transition induced density change in the -->
<!-- perovskite (Pv) phase, the spin transition in the octahedral (B) site in Al-free perovskite causes a bulk modulus -->
<!-- hardening (increase in the bulk modulus) in the mineral in the mixed spin state. -->

Numerical studies suggest that the overall impact of the changes in the properties of ferropericlase and perovskite can
be such that a descending cold slab approaching the mid-mantle at ~1600 km depth gains positive buoyancy (decrease in
density) that can slow the slab's descent rate or cause its stagnation. A stagnated slab may eventually penetrate into
the lower mantle (where it gains negative buoyancy) in the form of a sudden spin-transition induced mid-mantle avalanche
(SIMMA). On the other hand, the rising hot plumes from the core-mantle boundary that are slightly lighter due to the
spin-transition effects in the lower mantle become slightly heavier at the mid-mantle depths. This in turn may slow the
plumes or cause their stagnation at ~1600 km depth. Stagnated plumes may merge together and eventually reach the upper
levels of the lower mantle as *superplumes*.
