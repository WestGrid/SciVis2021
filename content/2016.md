### Visualizing multiple variables in a global ocean model

The inaugural *Visualize This!* Challenge received 125 expressions of interest from researchers across Canada and the
United States. Participants had 31 days to create a visualization solution for an oceanography model contributed by an
Earth Sciences researcher. The main challenge in the data was to visualize multiple 3D variables at the same time.

A University of Calgary (UofC) research team comprised of Allan Rocha, Usman Alim and Julio Daniel Silva has won first
prize for their creative approach to using layering, animation, and elements of interactivity in their submission. A
video of their submission can be viewed below:

"We started this project with a dream of being able to create layered visualizations on arbitrary surfaces to visualize
multiple attributes, such as we can see commonly in 2D," said Rocha, at the time a PhD Candidate and member of the <a

href="http://ires.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank"> Interactive Modeling, Visualization and Visual Analytics Research
Group</a> at the UofC. "These visualizations are inspired by concepts of painting and other aspects from art and
information visualization. From this thinking process, the decal-maps emerged."
